# Radiolockdown: Podcast Audio Analysis

- blog post [here](https://ruggerobettinardi.eu/blog/rdl-audio-segmentation/)

This repo contains the code I wrote to perform some analysis on the recorded episodes of [Radio Lockdown](https://radiolockdown.online/#/). 
In short, what I did was to:

1. *Speech-vs-Song* segmentation of the full audio trace;
2. *Speech-to-Text* of the segments where the radio speakers where chatting;
3. Create a *speech word-cloud image* to summarize the episode's hot topics (see my [SpeechCloud](https://github.com/rug-bettinardi/speechcloud) repo)
